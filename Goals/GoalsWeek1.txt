Notes
* Use checklist for Jirah
* Update my profile photo everywhere - setup
* Concentrate in small time period.

Dev Evaluation Criteria
☐ You understand one component/service or product functionality. You can answer colleagues' specific questions about it.
	
	9/9/2022: I have been able to teamwork with QA and answer questions about my stuff.

☐ You implement tasks under the direct supervision. You can implement the solution given by a Mentor/Sr Dev (Completed)

	9/9/2022: I have been implementig ideas and advices.

☐ You write understandable code. There may be critical concerns in the review. 
However, there is a positive trend towards fewer concerns in reviews. The quality of the code is improving all the time. 
You follow best practices.

	9/9/2022: I have implemented best practice in code. (In Progress)

☐ You are interested in programming and constantly develop skills. 
	Capable of figuring out the cause of an error with the help of the Internet. 
	Know the syntax of the programming language used and the inner workings of runtime. 
	Minimal familiarity with databases. Keep up with industry events.

	9/9/2022: 	I have been testing my proposed solutions to get improve accuracy for Tech Analysis (For difficult tickets => Proof of concept)
			I have been actively taking courses and taking the time to understand. 

*Problems with root cause. I should improve skill to try to find solution. (In PROGRESS)

☐ Task analysis with the help of product peers. (COMPLETED)
	* Teamwork Effort - TPMs - Angela, 
	*/ TechLead
	* QA
	* Prepare technical analysis and communicate.

	9/9/2022: I have performed TA by myself, receiving feedback and implementing solutions given by mentor.

☐ Able to do decomposition and evaluation of a typical task (1-2 product iterations) with the help of product colleagues. 
	May not be able to meet estimates and deadlines during implementation.

	9/9/2022: THERE IS GOING TO BE A BIG TICKET THAT I WOULD NEED TO SPLIT IT BUT MAYBE LATER I WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS

☐ You are avoiding asking the same thing twice, making progress. 
Instead, periodically offer solutions to problems. 
You can solve typical minor issues (e.g., code errors) by analyzing the code or searching the Internet. (IN PROGRESS, CHECKLIST GOOD IDEA)

	9/9/2022: 	I have been doing this without issues. When I have the mistake of thinking something twice then I implement control measures to ensure is not happening any more.
			I have been improving my notes and methods to come back to get information, definitions or next steps.

☐ Regularly give a status on the progress of the task to escalate problems in time (without getting stuck). Learn feedback from team members. (COMPLETED)

	9/9/2022: I have not had any problems with communicating.

☐ Implementing the task yourself from start to finish. (IN PROGRESS)

	9/9/2022: Almost, I have been getting help with some merge conflicts or reverts. I think is normal, the course in PluralSight and the Experience will make me improve.

☐ Know about splitting the application into layers and other design patterns. (IN PROGRESS)
	* STUDY: https://oneinc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROC1/pages/36780419/Component+vs+Product+explanation
	* WHEN I AM READING, GO TO THE PART OF THE CODE, UNDERSTAND WHERE TO IMPLEMENT MY TICKETS.

☐ Rarely make the same mistakes twice. Can quickly close gaps in knowledge when necessary. (IN PROGRESS)

☐ Independent analysis, decomposition, and evaluation of a typical task. (IN PROGRESS)



GOALS 9/9/2022
* CRYPTOGRAM DONE.
* ROMAN/EDUARDO WILL FIND A TICKET FOR ME THAT TAKES MORE EFFORT/EXPERTISE TO DECOMPOSE IT.
