Nate asked about Flexibility, how easy is to move from "users" to "group of users".

* Sharing logic for users
	* The structure of the DB allows username
	* 
	
* Start with the toggle

Priorities
1. Agreements of what the first phase will be
2. Scheduling

Agreements: 
* To have story to share with Roman and start TA - Responsible TPM?
* Nate and Avik to come up with one example flow that uses our current UI and an alternative (not in september but future sprint)
* To determine what would be the strategy on how to deal with results being different from userA and UserB? (Nate may solve this w/MVP)

Required fields wer not fulfilled to share

we might lose trust with the carriers.

Superset of settings to provide results.
for first phaase what about forcing feature only to those users that have the same setup for userA and userB
